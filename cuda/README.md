TODO add GPU edit distance support for sequence modified myers distance.

Since VRAM is becoming much larger in response to rise of AI needs, it may be faster to do distance calculation and bk-tree searches on GPU since we can send off huge maches of strings. In my use cases, the edit distance calculation is incredibly quick, its the moving the data to CPU is the main bottle neck. This could work well because we can send off a huge batch of reads comming of decompression stream to GPU and utlize the high speed bus of GPUs to quickly move the data for crunching. Doing this part on GPU would also free up CPU that I can use for follow up steps without impeding the bk-tree searches. I am not experienced with C so its taking some time to optimize the distance calculations and tree search.
